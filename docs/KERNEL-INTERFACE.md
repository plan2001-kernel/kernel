# Kernel interface principles

This document records current architectural boundaries, not a frozen binary
ABI and not a numbered syscall-reduction roadmap.

## Native object interface

Use object operations when the resource has identity, rights, ownership,
lifetime, delegation, or invocation semantics. Distinguish:

- Persistent GE/O identity: `(SpaceID, OID)`.
- Volatile object identity: boot/runtime scoped.
- Process-local Handle: capability/reference with bounded rights.
- Physical device selectors: provider-specific; not themselves authority.

A numeric selector must not grant access on its own. Rights must be checked at
the operation boundary. Revocation, final close, and process exit must handle
object/resource lifetimes coherently.

`runtime/abi/sys.h` and kernel dispatch/source implementations determine
**which syscalls currently exist and are active**. Do not infer active calls
from obsolete syscall inventories or try to meet a fixed count. The design
permits direct process/scalar calls when adding an object would not help.

## Device messages and ObjectFIFO

ObjectFIFO is the common capability-aware transport for framed messages and
IPC. Frame bytes and transport metadata should remain separate from object
identity. A FIFO does not grant independent device-control rights.

The current device integration distinguishes provider semantics:

- USB control transfers have synchronous provider completion and a
  session-owned pending response; do not claim that this is universal FIFO
  completion behavior.
- Raw Ethernet transmission reports accepted/enqueued L2 bytes, not physical
  completion. Receive frames are exposed as immutable message objects through
  a FIFO/subscription; device control is separately authorized.

Do not restore pathname-based `/dev` adapters, Plan 9 Chan/fid/qid, or
separate protocol-specific kernel syscall families just to reach userspace.
IPv6 protocol processing and the minimal ESP demonstration are userspace
concerns unless an explicit kernel requirement says otherwise.

## Development boundary

The basic proof of concept needs a functioning kernel-to-MicroPython path.
Do not treat old user-journey experiments, one-off networking demonstrations,
or old T-stage documents as current architecture mandates.

Implementation references: `runtime/abi/sys.h`, `kernel/core/`,
`kernel/drivers/`, `ge/storage/`, and `micropython/`. Verify exact
constants and structs against headers before changing code.
